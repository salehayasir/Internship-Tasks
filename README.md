DevelopersHub Internship Tasks
This repository contains the tasks completed as part of my internship at DevelopersHub. Each task focuses on applying data analysis and machine learning techniques using Python to solve real-world problems.

Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
Objective:
Explore the Iris dataset to understand its structure and visualize relationships between different features.

Approach:

Loaded and inspected the dataset using pandas and seaborn

Summarized key aspects using .shape, .head(), and .info()

Created visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots

Trained a basic logistic regression model for classification

Results and Insights:

The petal features (length and width) provided clear separation among species

Visualizations helped identify patterns and potential decision boundaries

Logistic regression achieved high accuracy with minimal preprocessing

Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
Objective:
Estimate medical insurance charges based on individual features such as age, BMI, and smoking status.

Approach:

Encoded categorical variables and used a linear regression model

Visualized the relationships between charges and features like BMI and smoking

Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error

Results and Insights:

Charges were significantly higher for smokers and individuals with high BMI

Linear regression provided a good baseline with interpretable results

Feature correlation helped understand real-world cost implications

Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
Objective:
Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.

Approach:

Performed exploratory analysis on features like age, job, and marital status

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Trained a logistic regression model and evaluated it with accuracy and a confusion matrix

Results and Insights:

Customer job type and education were strong indicators of loan acceptance

The model performed well in identifying likely respondents

Visualizations provided useful business insights about customer behavior

Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
